Copies of all inventories will be stored away from \nthe specific location. \n \nTEXTBOOKS: \nDISTRIBUTION AND CARE OF \nThe Tannehill Board of Education believes that all employees and students are responsible for the proper care of school facilities, \nequipment, and property in their use or under their control. \n \nCooperation is expected from the professional staff regarding the care and distribution of school-owned textbooks.  The superin-\ntendent may delegate authority to building principals for the care, custody, and distribution of textbooks, as well as other instructional \nmaterial and equipment. \n \nStudents are required to return all district-owned texts to the teacher who issued them at the end of the period of use. Failure to return \nbooks at the appropriate time will result in the student paying for the cost of the replacement. The student assumes the cost of any text \nlost or damaged. It must be paid before new text is issued or before credit for courses will be given. If a misplaced book is returned, \nthe student may be refunded any charges previously paid to the school for the book.  \n \nThe school district will not - and the superintendent is not authorized to - prevent a student from receiving a grade, to which the \nstudent is entitled, from graduating upon completion of graduation requirements, or from obtaining any records or information \nsupplied to the school or otherwise owned by the student. \n \nThe school district will forward all educational records of a student to another school district in which the child is enrolling within \nthree (3) business days of the request as per 70 O.S. \u00a7 24-101.4 regardless of whether all fines and fees have been paid by the former \nstudent.   \n \nTELEPHONES \nThe Tannehill Board of Education recognizes that telephone communications by staff and students are occasionally necessary.  \nHowever, classes must not be interrupted for routine telephone calls.   \n(See Student Handbook for Cellphone policy applying to student use) \n \nSchool staff may possess, without permission, wireless telecommunications devices on school property or while attending any school-\nsponsored activities on or off school property.  Wireless telecommunications devices include, but are not limited to, beepers, pagers, \nand cellular telephones.  Devices should be turned off while teachers are in their instructional setting with students.  Devices \nmay not be used while the teacher or other staff is in control of students unless needed for an emergency or needed for duties \nand responsibilities of that position.  Devices that include imaging capabilities such as phone cameras should be used with discretion \nand for positive promotional information when publishing to social media or school websites; namely: \n \n\u2022 \nDevices may be used in support of the educational process or to produce material/content for the school yearbook or school \nwebsite.  Staff should use care and discretion in capturing only images that report student achievement in a positive way.  \nEmbarrassing photos or images may be classified as cyberbullying and bring disciplinary action. \n \n\u2022 \nStaff should also be aware of policy on directory information and abide by parental requests regarding publication of their \nchild\u2019s photo or image. Some parents do not want their child\u2019s photo published. \n \n\u2022 \nStaff should also use discernment and refrain from excessive use of phone cameras and similar technology. \n \nSTAFF-STUDENT COMMUNICATIONS \nIt is the intent of the Tannehill Board of Education to make students, parents, and guardians aware of allowable \ncommunications between students and staff.", "answerable_text": ""}, {"index": "paragraph-0", "filename": "employee_handbook_print_1.pdf", "page_num": 10, "standardized_text": "School personnel shall refrain from communicating with students outside the school setting An exception will apply if the school administration receives written consent from a students parents or guardian which will outline the school related items that may be discussed and the preferred method of StaffStudent Communications If school personnel engage in communications with students outside the school setting and the communication conflicts with the written permission granted by the parentguardian of the student the employee shall be subject to disciplinary action by the school district Such disciplinary action could include termination of employment with the school district BUS DRIVERS AND USE OF TECHNOLOGY School bus drivers are prohibited from text messaging andor using cell phones while driving a school bus or school owned vehicle If an emergency situation arises the bus driver shall remove the bus from the roadway and place an emergency call to the appropriate legal authorities Any bus driver found to have engaged in text messaging or the nonschool emergency use of a cell phone while driving a school vehicle shall be subject to disciplinary measures which could include termination of employment It is not illegal for a school bus driver to utilize a handheld device when necessary to communicate with the central dispatch school transportation department or its equivalent In an emergency situation where a bus driver needs to use a handheld device to communicate with the school central office the bus driver shall remove the bus from the roadway and stop while communicating with the school office HEALTH INSURANCE The Tannehill Board of Education will provide a health insurance program for all teachers who work six hours or more and will pay the premium cost per month for each teacher in accordance with the provisions of state law Those teachers who opt out of the health insurance program may utilize the above amount toward any of the following fringe benefits", "question_text": "School personnel shall refrain from communicating with students outside the school setting.

It may also include the use of a computer or any digital device.  \nOklahoma Law \n \nNo Oklahoma law currently exists that prohibits sexting; however, there are several laws involving the possession and \ndistribution of child pornography, soliciting minors via electronic media and distributing obscene materials to minors. These \nare all sex crimes which may be related to sexting and are considered serious felonies.  \n \nPenalties upon conviction may include up to thirty years in state prison, quarterly registration as a sex offender, inclusion of the \nterm sex offender on a driver's license and mandatory use of an ankle monitor. \n \nReduction of Penalties for Minors \nAs the number of teens being prosecuted as sex offenders for consensual sexting increased in recent years, Oklahoma has \nattempted to mitigate the penalties for teen sexting. In 2014, Oklahoma enacted HB 2541 amending the state law to reduce \npenalties. Under 10A O.S. \u00a7 2-8-221, Oklahoma law lists potential penalties for consensual transmission of sexually explicit \nimages by and between minors, primarily to protect teens who receive unsolicited images and report them to school officials or \nlaw enforcement. \n \nAlthough Oklahoma has enacted laws to reduce the penalties minors face for consensual teen sexting, it is essential to \nremember that it is still a crime, and if it is not consensual, the crime(s) and/or penalties may increase. For example, a teen \naged 18 who engages in legal consensual sex with a teen aged 16 or 17 will face a child pornography prosecution if he or she \nmakes, receives or possess sexually explicit images of the teen under 18. \n \nTitle IX and Sexting  \nSexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that can include sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and \nother verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.", "answerable_text": ""}, {"index": "paragraph-0", "filename": "employee_handbook_print_1.pdf", "page_num": 57, "standardized_text": "Two Types of Sexual Harassment", "question_text": "Two Types of Sexual Harassment:", "answerable_text": ""}, {"index": "paragraph-1", "filename": "employee_handbook_print_1.pdf", "page_num": 57, "standardized_text": " Quid Pro Quo sexual favors demanded in exchange for some benefit or service", "question_text": "1. \"Quid Pro Quo\" - sexual favors demanded in exchange for some benefit or service.", "answerable_text": ""}, {"index": "paragraph-2", "filename": "employee_handbook_print_1.pdf", "page_num": 57, "standardized_text": " Hostile Environment unwelcome advances requests or physical conduct that interferes with an individuals performance or creates an intimidating hostile or offensive educational environment How to Handle Evidence", "question_text": "2. \"Hostile Environment\" - unwelcome advances, requests or physical conduct that interferes with an individual's performance \nor creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive educational environment. \nHow to Handle Evidence", "answerable_text": ""}, {"index": "paragraph-3", "filename": "employee_handbook_print_1.pdf", "page_num": 57, "standardized_text": " Place the cell phone in a plastic bag and call the police", "question_text": "1.

The board observes that this conduct: \n \n 1. \nHas been shown by national and state studies to have a substantial adverse effect upon school district operations, the \nsafety of students and faculty, and the educational system at large. \n \n 2. \nSubstantially disrupts school operations by interfering with the district\u2019s mission to instruct students in an atmosphere \nfree from fear, is disruptive of school efforts to encourage students to remain in school until graduation, and is just as \ndisruptive of the district\u2019s efforts to prepare students for productive lives in the community as they become adults. \n \n 3. \nSubstantially disrupts healthy student behavior and thereby academic achievement.  Research indicates that healthy \nstudent behavior results in increased student academic achievement.  Improvement in student behavior through the \nprevention or minimization of intimidation, harassment, and bullying towards student-victims simultaneously supports \nthe district\u2019s primary and substantial interest in operating schools that foster and promote academic achievement. \n \n 4. \nSubstantially interferes with school compliance with federal law that seeks to maximize the mainstreaming of students \nwith disabilities and hinders compliance with Individual Educational Programs containing objectives to increase the \nsocialization of students with disabilities.  Targets of bullying are often students with known physical or mental \ndisabilities who, as a result, are perceived by bullies as easy targets for bullying actions. \n \n 5. \nSubstantially interferes with the district\u2019s mission to advance the social skills and social and emotional well-being of \nstudents.  Targets of intimidation, harassment, and bullying are often \u201cpassive-target\u201d students who already are lacking \nin social skills because they tend to be extremely sensitive, shy, display insecurity, anxiety and/or distress; may have \nexperienced a traumatic event; may try to use gifts, toys, money, or class assignments or performance bribes to protect \nthemselves from intimidation, harassment, or bullying; are often small for their age and feel vulnerable to bullying acts; \nand/or may resort to carrying weapons to school for self-protection.  Passive-target victims who have been harassed and \ndemeaned by the behavior of bullies often respond by striving to obtain power over others by becoming bullies \nthemselves, and are specifically prone to develop into students who eventually inflict serious physical harm on other \nstudents, or, in an effort to gain power over their life or situation, commit suicide. \n \n 6. \nSubstantially disrupts school operations by increasing violent acts committed against fellow students.  Violence, in this \ncontext, is frequently accompanied by criminal acts. \n \n 7. \nSubstantially disrupts school operations by interfering with the reasonable expectations of other students that they can \nfeel secure at school and not be subjected to frightening acts or be the victim of mistreatment resulting from bullying \nbehavior. \n \nBullying often involves expressive gestures, speech, physical acts that are sexually suggestive, lewd, vulgar, profane, or \noffensive to the education or social mission of this school district, and at times involves the commission of criminal acts.  This \nbehavior interferes with the curriculum by disrupting the presentation of instruction and also disrupts and interferes with the", "answerable_text": ""}, {"index": "paragraph-0", "filename": "employee_handbook_print_1.pdf", "page_num": 66, "standardized_text": "studentvictims or bystanders ability to concentrate retain instruction and study or to operate free from the effects of bullying This results in a reluctance or resistance to attend school Definition of Terms Statutory definition of harassment intimidation and bullying", "question_text": "student-victim\u2019s or bystander\u2019s ability to concentrate, retain instruction, and study or to operate free from the effects of \nbullying.

While the use of medical marijuana in conjunction with the possession of a \nmedical marijuana license is legal in the State of Oklahoma, marijuana is a prohibited controlled substance \nunder federal law regardless of the use being for medical purposes. Accordingly, possession of marijuana by a \nstudent, employee, parent or any individual, notwithstanding the possession of a medical marijuana license, is \nstrictly prohibited while on the premises of the district and in school vehicles; going to and from sponsored \nfunctions, events, and athletic activities which occur in a location other than the premises of the district; \nutilizing district equipment or transportation; and in any other instance in connection with the district where the \ndistrict reasonably deems the possession of marijuana to be illegal. \n \nIn the event that a student, employee, parent or any individual is found to possess or to have possessed \nmarijuana in any of the instances stated above, the district will proceed with all actions and consequences that \nare afforded under any state or federal law, employment contract, district policy, student handbook provision, or \nany other authority applicable to or adopted by the district. \n \nDefinitions \n \nThe terms \u201cmarijuana\u201d and \u201cpossession of marijuana\u201d will be interpreted by the district in accordance with state \nand federal law. The term \u201cmarijuana\u201d includes, but is not limited to, any form of marijuana; all parts of the \nplant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; marijuana seeds; marijuana oil, extract, resin, or residue; \ncannabidiol in any form; and marijuana edibles. Any conflict between state and federal law as to the definition \nof \u201cmarijuana\u201d or \u201cpossession of marijuana\u201d will be interpreted in favor of federal law. \n \nNondiscrimination \n \nThere will be no discrimination in the district because of an individual\u2019s status as medical marijuana license \nholder. \n \nOverlap With Other District Policies \n \nThe district recognizes that the legal aspects and consequences of medical marijuana are new and possibly \nsubject to change. These legal aspects and consequences of medical marijuana effect many areas of the district\u2019s \ncurrent policies regarding employees, students, parents and individuals on district premises or attending district \nevents. The district will continue to enforce its current adopted policies.

It may also include the use of a computer or any digital device.  \nOklahoma Law \n \nNo Oklahoma law currently exists that prohibits sexting; however, there are several laws involving the possession and \ndistribution of child pornography, soliciting minors via electronic media and distributing obscene materials to minors. These \nare all sex crimes which may be related to sexting and are considered serious felonies.  \n \nPenalties upon conviction may include up to thirty years in state prison, quarterly registration as a sex offender, inclusion of the \nterm sex offender on a driver's license and mandatory use of an ankle monitor. \n \nReduction of Penalties for Minors \nAs the number of teens being prosecuted as sex offenders for consensual sexting increased in recent years, Oklahoma has \nattempted to mitigate the penalties for teen sexting. In 2014, Oklahoma enacted HB 2541 amending the state law to reduce \npenalties. Under 10A O.S. \u00a7 2-8-221, Oklahoma law lists potential penalties for consensual transmission of sexually explicit \nimages by and between minors, primarily to protect teens who receive unsolicited images and report them to school officials or \nlaw enforcement. \n \nAlthough Oklahoma has enacted laws to reduce the penalties minors face for consensual teen sexting, it is essential to \nremember that it is still a crime, and if it is not consensual, the crime(s) and/or penalties may increase. For example, a teen \naged 18 who engages in legal consensual sex with a teen aged 16 or 17 will face a child pornography prosecution if he or she \nmakes, receives or possess sexually explicit images of the teen under 18. \n \nTitle IX and Sexting  \nSexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that can include sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and \nother verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.", "answerable_text": ""}, {"index": "paragraph-0", "filename": "employee_handbook_print_1.pdf", "page_num": 57, "standardized_text": "Two Types of Sexual Harassment", "question_text": "Two Types of Sexual Harassment:", "answerable_text": ""}, {"index": "paragraph-1", "filename": "employee_handbook_print_1.pdf", "page_num": 57, "standardized_text": " Quid Pro Quo sexual favors demanded in exchange for some benefit or service", "question_text": "1. \"Quid Pro Quo\" - sexual favors demanded in exchange for some benefit or service.", "answerable_text": ""}, {"index": "paragraph-2", "filename": "employee_handbook_print_1.pdf", "page_num": 57, "standardized_text": " Hostile Environment unwelcome advances requests or physical conduct that interferes with an individuals performance or creates an intimidating hostile or offensive educational environment How to Handle Evidence", "question_text": "2. \"Hostile Environment\" - unwelcome advances, requests or physical conduct that interferes with an individual's performance \nor creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive educational environment. \nHow to Handle Evidence", "answerable_text": ""}, {"index": "paragraph-3", "filename": "employee_handbook_print_1.pdf", "page_num": 57, "standardized_text": " Place the cell phone in a plastic bag and call the police", "question_text": "1.

The board observes that this conduct: \n \n 1. \nHas been shown by national and state studies to have a substantial adverse effect upon school district operations, the \nsafety of students and faculty, and the educational system at large. \n \n 2. \nSubstantially disrupts school operations by interfering with the district\u2019s mission to instruct students in an atmosphere \nfree from fear, is disruptive of school efforts to encourage students to remain in school until graduation, and is just as \ndisruptive of the district\u2019s efforts to prepare students for productive lives in the community as they become adults. \n \n 3. \nSubstantially disrupts healthy student behavior and thereby academic achievement.  Research indicates that healthy \nstudent behavior results in increased student academic achievement.  Improvement in student behavior through the \nprevention or minimization of intimidation, harassment, and bullying towards student-victims simultaneously supports \nthe district\u2019s primary and substantial interest in operating schools that foster and promote academic achievement. \n \n 4. \nSubstantially interferes with school compliance with federal law that seeks to maximize the mainstreaming of students \nwith disabilities and hinders compliance with Individual Educational Programs containing objectives to increase the \nsocialization of students with disabilities.  Targets of bullying are often students with known physical or mental \ndisabilities who, as a result, are perceived by bullies as easy targets for bullying actions. \n \n 5. \nSubstantially interferes with the district\u2019s mission to advance the social skills and social and emotional well-being of \nstudents.  Targets of intimidation, harassment, and bullying are often \u201cpassive-target\u201d students who already are lacking \nin social skills because they tend to be extremely sensitive, shy, display insecurity, anxiety and/or distress; may have \nexperienced a traumatic event; may try to use gifts, toys, money, or class assignments or performance bribes to protect \nthemselves from intimidation, harassment, or bullying; are often small for their age and feel vulnerable to bullying acts; \nand/or may resort to carrying weapons to school for self-protection.  Passive-target victims who have been harassed and \ndemeaned by the behavior of bullies often respond by striving to obtain power over others by becoming bullies \nthemselves, and are specifically prone to develop into students who eventually inflict serious physical harm on other \nstudents, or, in an effort to gain power over their life or situation, commit suicide. \n \n 6. \nSubstantially disrupts school operations by increasing violent acts committed against fellow students.  Violence, in this \ncontext, is frequently accompanied by criminal acts. \n \n 7. \nSubstantially disrupts school operations by interfering with the reasonable expectations of other students that they can \nfeel secure at school and not be subjected to frightening acts or be the victim of mistreatment resulting from bullying \nbehavior. \n \nBullying often involves expressive gestures, speech, physical acts that are sexually suggestive, lewd, vulgar, profane, or \noffensive to the education or social mission of this school district, and at times involves the commission of criminal acts.  This \nbehavior interferes with the curriculum by disrupting the presentation of instruction and also disrupts and interferes with the", "answerable_text": ""}, {"index": "paragraph-0", "filename": "employee_handbook_print_1.pdf", "page_num": 66, "standardized_text": "studentvictims or bystanders ability to concentrate retain instruction and study or to operate free from the effects of bullying This results in a reluctance or resistance to attend school Definition of Terms Statutory definition of harassment intimidation and bullying", "question_text": "student-victim\u2019s or bystander\u2019s ability to concentrate, retain instruction, and study or to operate free from the effects of \nbullying.

While the use of medical marijuana in conjunction with the possession of a \nmedical marijuana license is legal in the State of Oklahoma, marijuana is a prohibited controlled substance \nunder federal law regardless of the use being for medical purposes. Accordingly, possession of marijuana by a \nstudent, employee, parent or any individual, notwithstanding the possession of a medical marijuana license, is \nstrictly prohibited while on the premises of the district and in school vehicles; going to and from sponsored \nfunctions, events, and athletic activities which occur in a location other than the premises of the district; \nutilizing district equipment or transportation; and in any other instance in connection with the district where the \ndistrict reasonably deems the possession of marijuana to be illegal. \n \nIn the event that a student, employee, parent or any individual is found to possess or to have possessed \nmarijuana in any of the instances stated above, the district will proceed with all actions and consequences that \nare afforded under any state or federal law, employment contract, district policy, student handbook provision, or \nany other authority applicable to or adopted by the district. \n \nDefinitions \n \nThe terms \u201cmarijuana\u201d and \u201cpossession of marijuana\u201d will be interpreted by the district in accordance with state \nand federal law. The term \u201cmarijuana\u201d includes, but is not limited to, any form of marijuana; all parts of the \nplant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; marijuana seeds; marijuana oil, extract, resin, or residue; \ncannabidiol in any form; and marijuana edibles. Any conflict between state and federal law as to the definition \nof \u201cmarijuana\u201d or \u201cpossession of marijuana\u201d will be interpreted in favor of federal law. \n \nNondiscrimination \n \nThere will be no discrimination in the district because of an individual\u2019s status as medical marijuana license \nholder. \n \nOverlap With Other District Policies \n \nThe district recognizes that the legal aspects and consequences of medical marijuana are new and possibly \nsubject to change. These legal aspects and consequences of medical marijuana effect many areas of the district\u2019s \ncurrent policies regarding employees, students, parents and individuals on district premises or attending district \nevents. The district will continue to enforce its current adopted policies.
