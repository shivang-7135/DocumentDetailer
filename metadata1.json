The in\ufb02uences of trade, existence of news\nagencies, national traits and cultural and geographic proximity on these two news websites were\nexamined. The international news from the online version was analyzed and compared with the\nprint and broadcast versions. The study found that trade volume and existence of news agencies\nare two leading predictors of international news coverage in both online and traditional media.

Any information \u2013 in varied format and with different features\n\u2013 can easily be transmitted and posted on the Web and accessed by viewers around\nthe globe at any time. Unlike print or broadcast media, web-based news media, theo-\nretically, can upload as many stories as possible and provide as many links as neces-\nsary to inform, entertain and educate audiences. In addition, due to its extremely\n\ufb02uid data-sharing capacity, digitalized information can be stored, packaged and then\ndisplayed in a user-friendly fashion. Thus, as Carey (1998) said, the web is truly a\nglobal medium that can tackle the unmatched mission of receiving and dissemi-\nnating international news to every corner of the world, narrowing the gigantic\ndiscrepancy between the news world and the real world.\nWith all the exciting potential and given the profound changes in the new\nmedia environment (Pavlik, 2001), the phenomenon of news \ufb02ow across national\nborders should be reconsidered \u2013 and re-examined.

First of all, the excuse of limited\nspace in newspapers or broadcast media \u2013 the most common reason for the un-\nbalanced international coverage in the past \u2013 does not exist in the web media any\nmore. The virtually unlimited web space allows news professionals to publish stories\nabout countries that were rarely caught on the radar screen of conventional outlets.\nAlso, the scope and orientation of journalistic attention to the world can be broad-\nened. A survey done by Wu and Hamilton (2004) showed that foreign correspon-\ndents\u2019 routines seem to have altered with the advent of the Internet. Moreover, the\nreporting on the web now is not only serving the traditional, geographically bound\nreaders or viewers any more. Instead, surfers of certain websites can come from all\nover the world, challenging the existing market structure of news providers, users\nand advertisers (Pavlik, 2001: 30\u20135).\nAnother rationale of investigating news \ufb02ow in the new media environment is\nthat having independent editorial/reporting crew working exclusively for the Internet\nhas become an industry norm in the US (Pavlik, 2001). Although a good number\nof stories can be shared (thanks to the digital revolution and growing practice of\nconvergence) across different media outlets, the \ufb01nal production of a web-based\nnews site is often executed separately from other news operations within the same\nmedia conglomerates. Moreover, the sheer speed of information transmission and\nresourcefulness of the web \u2013 in terms of available news copy and audio/video clips\nfrom all over the world at the \ufb01ngertips of web developers \u2013 easily surpass the\nrepertoire traditional media can obtain and present with. New media staff, however,\ndo not necessarily have strong journalistic credentials or embrace the same standards\nand practices of other journalists in the newsroom; instead, they are in their current\npositions primarily because they are experts in developing websites (Pavlik, 2001).\nGiven all this, it would be interesting to explore whether the factors affecting the\ninternational news menu on traditional media are shaping the websites as well.\nWith Internet as the medium, the working environment and the approaches of\nstorytelling for journalists have been changed dramatically. This change might result\nin a different presentation of news \u2013 particularly international news. Studying the\nuse of links to other sources of information on the web, for example, Tremayne\n(2004) found that stories about international relations have more hyperlinks than\nother types of stories. Arant and Anderson (2001) discovered that online news\npractices have been affected negatively by the speed of online production and by\na different breed of journalists working within the Internet environment. They also\nfound that some online editors resemble wire editors since they simply cannot\ncheck all the stories they publish. The online editors\u2019 attitude toward international\nnews as a category, however, was not examined by their study. The presentation of\ninternational news content delivered by the media\u2019s online division, therefore, merits\nan empirical investigation.\nAnother unique facet of Internet-based international news coverage is the\nevasive audience of websites \u2013 \u2018netzens\u2019 come from every corner of the world and\nchallenge the traditional, locale-bound de\ufb01nition of audiences.

Ironically, studies (Gasher and\nGabriele, 2004; Singer, 2001) that utilized content analysis to compare the difference\nbetween hard-copy and online editions of mid-sized papers found that newspaper\nwebsites seem to focus more on local news than their print counterparts. It could\nbe, of course, a totally different story for major information hubs like The New York\nTimes on the Web, for instance, which serves well beyond the bounds of New York\nCity. These top websites often enjoy high traf\ufb01c when international news breaks.\nThis study aims to investigate the determinants of international news coverage\non two major news websites and to compare the \ufb01ndings with the predictors of\ntheir print and broadcast counterparts. With more and more audiences relying\nexclusively on the Internet to be abreast of what is going on around the world, the\nimpact of web-based news should not be underestimated. It is the hope that the\n\ufb01ndings of this study can reveal the forces underpinning international news that\ncan shape the worldview of worldwide audiences.\nLiterature Review\nA great number of factors were found to in\ufb02uence the volume of news from foreign\ncountries in traditional media. Chang and Lee (1992) and Shoemaker et al. (1991)\nfocused on examining the characteristics and news values of those stories chosen\nby editors. Others concentrated on the contextual and systemic factors of the\ncountries in question, such as economic interaction, geographic distance and cultural\nproximity between the nation being covered and the nation where the media is\nbased. This article argues that the news values of stories delivered via the web are\nprobably retained whereas the contextual factors of web-based production of\ninternational news have changed profoundly and, therefore, differ from those of\ntraditional media. Given this, the literature reviewed concentrates on the latter group.\nThe rationale for a survey of literature examining traditional media is that despite the\nchanged production environment for web-based media, it can be rewarding to\nsystematically review the determinants yielded from relevant studies and examine\nwhether the determinants hold true for the web-based media. These contextual and\nsystemic predictors of news \ufb02ow across national borders can be separated into four\ngroups: (1) economic interaction; (2) presence of international news agencies; (3)\ntraits of nation; and (4) cultural and geographic proximity to the US. Each of these\nfour groups of variables is now discussed.\nEconomic Interaction\nIn a seminal study about extra-media factors\u2019 in\ufb02uence on transnational news \ufb02ow,\nRosengren (1977) found that trade is positively linked to volume of news coverage\nin the press of Germany, the Netherlands and the UK and later con\ufb01rmed by Ahern\n(1984) using a US newspaper sample. The predictor of economic interactivity\nbetween nations was also supported by other studies (Charles et al., 1979; Kariel\nand Rosenvall, 1984; Wu, 2000) published during the last three decades that used\ndata from media of various countries.

In a recent study that examined the online edition of\na Montreal paper, Gasher and Gabriele (2004) found that the website actually relied\nmore heavily on wire services than its hard-copy counterpart. Despite the funda-\nmental, technological advantages of the Internet, the news professionals in the web\ndepartment appear to be still under the reign of international news agencies as their\ncolleagues of traditional media. Hence, the second hypothesis was formed as:\nH2: Presence of international news agencies in a country can predict the volume\nof international news from that country on the web.\nTraits of Nation\nThe traits of a country might affect the level of its newsworthiness in the media of\nother countries: the countries with bigger territory and having more population\nseem to carry more weight on the world stage, which can be translated to volumi-\nnous coverage. Empirical studies of news \ufb02ow conducted with a traditional media\nsample, however, found con\ufb02icting results across countries. For example, Rosengren\n(1977) found that geographic size and population of a nation are positively related\nto the nation\u2019s news quantity only in the media of some European countries but not\nin others. Nevertheless, when regressed into a prediction model along with other\nfactors in another study (Wu, 2000), these two determinants turn out statistically\ninsigni\ufb01cant. Another common determinant of news \ufb02ow in traditional media is a\ncountry\u2019s economic power \u2013 those countries with higher GDP tend to receive more\ncoverage (Ahern, 1984; Ishii, 1996). Based on the aforementioned \ufb01ndings stemmed\nfrom traditional media, the following three hypotheses were formed to test web-\nbased international news \ufb02ow:\nH3: GDP of a country can predict its amount of news coverage on the web.\nH4: Population of a country can predict its amount of news coverage on the web.\nH5: Geographic size of a country can predict its amount of news coverage on\nthe web.", "answerable_text": ""}, {"index": "paragraph-2", "filename": "Wu2007.pdf", "page_num": 6, "standardized_text": " THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION GAZETTE VOL NO SAGE Publications All rights reserved Not for commercial use or unauthorized distribution at BOSTON UNIV on December Downloaded from", "question_text": "542\nTHE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION GAZETTE VOL. 69 NO. 6\n \n\u00a9 2007 SAGE Publications.

Of the studies in\nthis category, a number of them (Johnson, 1997; Kariel and Rosenvall, 1983; Kim\nand Barnett, 1996) found an impact of ethnic bond and shared language on the\namount of information traf\ufb01cking across national borders. In the age of the Internet,\nit seems likely that news written in English can be transmitted more easily via the\ninformation superhighway into the US media and subsequently published on their\nwebsites. Also, given the increasing number of new immigrants into the US during\nthe 1990s,1 it is possible that the news media might pay more attention to those\ncountries where new immigrants come from. Lastly, in line with this group of thought,\ninternational travelers could trigger news coverage about their original countries;\nthus the number of international visitors to the US should probably be recognized\nas one of the facets of cultural interaction. Based on the aforementioned thoughts\nabout cultural proximity, I hypothesize that:\nH6: The countries with English as their national language can lead to a greater\namount of news coverage on the web.\nH7: The number of immigrants from a country can predict its amount of news\ncoverage on the web.\nH8: The number of visitors from a country to the US can predict its amount of\nnews coverage on the web.\nEven though a few studies (for a review, see Wu, 1998) have indicated the in\ufb02u-\nence of geographic distance on international news \ufb02ow, this factor seems far from\nconclusive. Chang et al. (1987) found that this factor only affected television networks\nbut not print media. In studies that examined multiple countries, Rosengren (1977)\nand Wu (2004) both found that the geographic proximity factor only matters to the\nmedia in some countries, particularly those in developing ones. Given the nature of\nthe web, geographic distance is supposedly a non-factor to the medium\u2019s operation.\nHowever, to verify this suspicion, the following research hypothesis was formed:\nH9: A nation\u2019s geographic distance to the US can predict its amount of news\ncoverage on the web.\nGiven all the intrinsic differences between the Internet and traditional media,\nthere is an expected difference in prediction of international news coverage. The\nliterature, nevertheless, has yet to provide a clear direction as to where and how\nthe variation of international news \ufb02ow via the two kinds of media may lie. There-\nfore, the following exploratory research question about the potential difference of\npredictors of international news coverage was formed:\nRQ1: How are predictors of international news coverage different between the\nInternet and traditional media?", "answerable_text": "Even though the level of press freedom in foreign countries was found to have\nno signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uence on American traditional news media (Wu, 2000), it remains\nunclear whether this factor would in\ufb02uence news \ufb02ow via cyberspace.

Despite the multiple sources of infor-\nmation about foreign countries to which US media usually have access, it is reason-\nable to speculate that reduced access to the web in a nation could result in\ndiminished information \ufb02ow and subsequently decrease the coverage of that nation\nin US media sites. Therefore, we explore this factor with the second question:\nRQ2: Is the level of press freedom of a country related to its amount of coverage\non the web?", "answerable_text": "Method\nThis study utilized content analysis to code all sampled international news from The\nNew York Times, Cable Network News (CNN), The New York Times on the Web\n(www.nytimes.com) and CNN\u2019s website, cnn.com. The rationale to select The New\nYork Times and CNN is that these two are elite media in the US and can wield\nnotable in\ufb02uence on the audience as well as other media. According to Nielsen\u2019s\nweb ratings for 2003, both sites were ranked among the top three news sites \u2013 in\nterms of page views and unique visitors \u2013 in the US. Another reason to choose these\ntwo media is that it allows a comparison of the potential differences between the\nprint/broadcast version and the online edition. Two composite weeks were randomly\nselected between September 2003 and December 2003. For the print version of The\nNew York Times, all of the issues during the two composite weeks were purchased.\nBecause cable broadcasters and websites are able to update their news menu\nin a shorter cycle, multiple data collections for each day of the two weeks were\nimplemented for cnn.com and www.nytimes.com. Three regular news programs on\nCNN \u2013 8\u201310 a.m., 4\u20135 p.m. and 9\u201310 p.m. central time \u2013 were recorded during the\nsampled days. These slots are more traditional news shows instead of interview,\ndiscussion or debate-centered shows. Data collection for both websites presents a\ndifferent kind of challenge, thanks to such characteristics of the web as multi-media\nand link functions. The researcher had to browse each news category/folder \u2013 e.g.\nbusiness, international, sports and culture \u2013 provided on the main site and subse-\nquently visited each news category until all of the stories in each category and\nsubcategory were inspected. There are links on cnn.com and nytimes.com sites that\nlead to other media sites. Our rule of thumb in story retrieving was that as long as a\nstory was published within the cnn.com or www.nytimes.com domain addresses then\nthat story was eligible for being included in the sample. When choosing international\nnews for the sample, the researcher\u2019s rule of thumb was to see whether the headline,\nsubhead, dateline and the \ufb01rst two paragraphs of the story contained any foreign\nnations or names of foreign nationals. In other words, as long as a story involved a\nforeign country or foreign national, that story was included. Lastly, for an inter-\nnational story on the sites to be included in the sample it had to have the sampled\nday\u2019s dateline. This operational de\ufb01nition is needed since sometimes out-of-date\nstories are left on the sites. The international stories published on www.nytimes.com\nand cnn.com were downloaded twice a day \u2013 \ufb01rst in early morning and then in the\nlate afternoon so as to capture the updates.

These nations are: the United Arab Emirates, India, Pakistan,\nColumbia, Georgia and Indonesia.\nWith both groups of media coverage examined together, one can see that the\ncon\ufb02ict in the Middle East captured the largest part of the available international\nnewshole, airtime and web space \u2013 Iraq, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan,\nIran and Saudi Arabia are all on the list. Additionally, the US media devoted substan-\ntial space to covering the major economic powerhouses such as Japan and Germany\nand military giants like Russia and China. Other than these nations, two South Asian\nnations and three Latin American nations \u2013 Mexico, Cuba and Colombia \u2013 were\nnotably covered. One should, however, note that since the stories on the websites\noutnumber those in the traditional media, the combined result from both groups\u2019\noutput is inevitably tilted toward the web\u2019s in\ufb02uence.\nThe prediction model for news \ufb02ow on the websites examines the in\ufb02uence of\nfour groups of independent variables \u2013 trade volume, news agency, traits of nations\nand cultural/geographic proximity \u2013 on the amount of news foreign nations received\nin the US media. Each group of independent variables was entered as a block in\nthe hierarchical regression analysis. Since Iraq represented a huge proportion of\nnews during the time and can severely distort the prediction model (Mahalanobis\u2019\ndistance test indicates it is the greatest outlier), the country was removed from the\ncase list. One can see from Table 2 that overall the model predicts better for\ntraditional media than for online media (total R2 = .546 vs .380), which provides a\npartial answer to RQ1. Also, Table 2 shows that trade, presence of news agencies\nand proximity block are signi\ufb01cant in determining international news coverage for\nboth online and traditional media. However, the statistics of R2 change indicate that\nthe net in\ufb02uence of news agency appears to be the most signi\ufb01cant one in the\nprediction model for online media and its in\ufb02uence seems larger than that in the\ntraditional media model (\u0001R2 = .212 vs .161). This is another profound difference\nbetween the two models that addresses RQ1. This \ufb01nding appears to support\nGasher and Gabriele (2004), who contended that there exists a greater in\ufb02uence\nof news agencies on online media than traditional media.\nThe prediction power of trade volume in the regression model for online news\nseems not as strong as in the traditional media counterpart (\u0001R2 = .115 vs .310),\nalthough it is still statistically signi\ufb01cant at less than .1 percent. It is interesting to\n\ufb01nd that the block of national trait variables, including geographic size, GDP and\npopulation, does not survive the signi\ufb01cance test in either model. This \ufb01nding seems\ncounterintuitive but actually is in accordance with some existing literature (e.g.\nLarson, 1979; Robinson and Sparkes, 1976) that examined international coverage\nin the US media.\nThe last group of predictors in the regression model yields a somewhat con\ufb02ict-\ning and confusing result despite its signi\ufb01cance level as a block. We can see that\nEnglish language, geographic distance and number of immigrants into the US are not\nsigni\ufb01cant factors in predicting news \ufb02owing from other parts of the world to US\nmedia; also these factors\u2019 directions of in\ufb02uence are con\ufb02icting between online and\ntraditional media.

There are signi\ufb01cant overlaps between\nthe most covered nations \u2013 Middle-Eastern countries, economic elites and military\npowers still dominate the news space on the web. The correlation test also indicates\na high resemblance between traditional and online media. Therefore, the overall\npicture of the world presented by the websites re\ufb02ects their traditional media\ncounterparts well. This discovery could be a great disappointment for those who\nideally envisioned the web as a truly global medium that can break away from the\nstructural, systematic barriers to deliver more \u2013 and more diverse \u2013 information to\npeople around the world. Ironically, the power of news agencies, the old guard of\ninternational news \ufb02ow, seems to have resurged with the help of the Internet.\nThe research \ufb01ndings also indicate that online media share some of the deter-\nminants of international news \ufb02ow found in traditional media, particularly the magni-\ntude of economic interactivity between the US and other countries and the presence\nof major news agencies. However, the in\ufb02uence of news agencies seems to escalate\nas the impact of trade volume wanes slightly in online media. Established news\nwebsites turn out to rely even more on primary news providers than newspapers or\nbroadcasters. Perhaps, as Arant and Anderson (2001) suggested, web editors act\npretty much like wire editors \u2013 they do not necessarily trust or resort to alternative\nsources more, nor do they have the resources or needed experience to produce\ninternational news on their own, even though they have virtually unlimited space\nto publish international news. They share with traditional news professionals or suffer\neven more on one limitation: time constraint. Consequently, the websites tend to\nprovide more of the same \u2013 updates and breaking news \u2013 rather than different kinds\nof international news to netzens. This phenomenon is rather intriguing and certainly\nmerits further investigation on website production and information processing by\nweb staff in both the US and other countries.\nThis study also concludes that national traits such as geographic size, GDP\n,\npopulation and press freedom rating are not systematically related to the quantity\nof coverage foreign nations received in the US media \u2013 be they print, broadcast or\nonline. Additionally, the impact of cultural proximity factors on the web seems un-\ncertain \u2013 more likely to be irrelevant. Given these \ufb01ndings, one may suspect that the\neconomic factor \u2013 the pressure to save money in web news production by import-\ning more copy available from the news agencies \u2013 is the prime suspect behind the\nscene. After all, covering foreign locales is an expensive operation for news media.\nUnder the tremendous pressure from shareholders and \ufb01erce competition in the\nmarketplace, media executives would \ufb01nd every means to cut cost to boost pro\ufb01t\nand good, responsible international reporting usually is the \ufb01rst to be sacri\ufb01ced\n(Hoge, 1997). And the web proves no panacea to the decline or abated diversity of\ninternational news in the US media.\nIt is also interesting to discover that even with a news sample selected during\nthe Iraq War period the determinant of trade volume still holds in both traditional\nand online prediction models. And this \ufb01nding echoes prior studies that examined\nthe US media\u2019s international coverage.
